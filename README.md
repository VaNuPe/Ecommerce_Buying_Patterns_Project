# Ecommerce_Buying_Patterns_Project
Examined data to identify the correlation between customer buying behavior and ecommerce marketing strategy using NumPy, pandas, Jupyter, matplotlib, and Excel.

## Context
[Instacart](https://www.instacart.com) is an existing company, an online grocery store that operates in the USA and Canada through an app. I have performed an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to target different customer profiles to help Instacart stakeholders implement a targeted marketing strategy. 

## Key Questions
- Identify the busiest days of the week and hours of the day to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
- Identify particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
- Simpler price range groupings to help direct marketing and sales campaigns.
- Identify the departments that have the highest frequency of product orders.
- Customer profiling, including factors such as brand loyalty, region, age, family status, and income.
